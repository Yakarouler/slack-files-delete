# Slack Files Delete
> Script for bulk delete files in slack.

I love Slack, but I don't have money enough to pay for all users in my company.

The first problem is the 10k message history limit, it's ok, I can deal with that. The second is the storage limit for files.

That second problem you nedd to delete old files to free space and still upload and share files. To do this, you need to open slack, find files and delete each one, there's no way to bulk delete.

So, i write this script to do this form me.

## Using

You will need to clone this repo and just execute in your terminal like this:

  python main.py
